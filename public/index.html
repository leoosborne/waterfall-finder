        <p class="fs-body-md ff-body txt-dark-600 ">There is something wonderous about a waterfall — candy for those of
          us who love exploring nature — when water, heeding gravity's pull, slowly carves its stories into stone. Among
          the most magical are the intermittent waterfalls. Most of them hidden deep in the woods, on unnamed
          watercourses, fed only by a chance rainstorm, bursting into life for a short time, then quickly draining the
          hillside and leaving only ancient trails worn into rock as evidence.</p>
        <p class="fs-body-md ff-body txt-dark-600 ">To expereince these fleeting wonders, one must not only know <span
            class="fw-bold">where</span>
          to find them, but <span class="fw-bold">when</span> to go looking for them. </p>
        <p class="fs-body-md ff-body txt-dark-600 ">Waterfall Finder takes the guesswork out of chasing waterfalls. We
          share the secrets of where and when in hopes you will choose to seek out some of these lesser seen waterfalls
          in their delicate, fleeting brilliance. We believe that if more people expereince these special places,
          the better our chances are of protecting them.</p>

          <p class="fs-body-md ff-body txt-dark-600">Mammoth Cave is a national treasure. Located near Brownsville, KY,
            Mammoth Cave has a long history of exploration and use by humans, dating back to prehistory when people used
            it for shelter and collecting crystals and salts. During the late 1700s, the cave was "resdiscovered" as a
            source of saltpeter, which was mined to make gunpowder for the War of 1812. In 1816, it quickly gained the
            attention of the nacent America tourisim industry as a privately owned attraction that saw millions of
            visitors long before it became a national park, while at the same time serving as a hospital for
            tuberculosis patients. The cave system began the transition from private to public ownership in 1926 and
            attained National Park status in 1941.</p>

          <h4 class="fs-mobile-h3 ff-heading txt-dark-600 fw-regular">Above Ground at Mammoth Cave</h4>
          <p class="fs-body-md ff-body txt-dark-600">The formation of Mammoth Cave started over 330 million years ago
            when sediments were deposited in a shallow inland sea and later hardened to become limestone and sandstone.
            The green river and its surrounding stream valley eventually carved underground streams through the softer
            limestone while leaving the harder sandstone layers in tact. This same process is continues today, both
            below the ground to form the cave system, and also above ground the sculpt waterfalls, rock houses, sink
            holes and other karst topography formations. </p>
          <p class="fs-body-md ff-body txt-dark-600"> The Park has many hiking trails that lead to sink holes, creek
            beds, overlooks and camping sites. The trails are a great way to get started in exploring the area, but to
            find the intermittent waterfalls one must leave the ease of the trail and follow the creeks down into the
            valleys. This is where to find the hidden waterfalls. With a little advanced research and preparation, you
            will be able to see these falls when they are flowing.</p>

          <p class="fs-body-md ff-body txt-dark-600"> To be safe, comfortable and happy during your adventure, you
            should first learn the basics of navigating by map and compass (GPS and internet are not always reliable in
            wild places), know how to safely hike off-trail ("bushwhacking"), how to protect the native flora and fauna,
            how to leave no trace of your passage, how to pack the essentials of food, water and clothing, how to be
            prepared to treat minor injuries and to always let someone know where you are going and when you expect to
            return. Knowing these things is essential to responsibly visiting the backcountry, and easy to learn from
            books or by hiking with friends who have already acquired the necessary skills.</p>
